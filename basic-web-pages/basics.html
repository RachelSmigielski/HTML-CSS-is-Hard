    <h1>Interneting is Easy!</h1>
    <!-- The higher the number of the heading, the more prominent it looks-->
    <p>First, we need to learn some basic HTML.</p>

    <h2>Headings</h2>
    <p>Headings define the outline of your site. There are six levels of
    headings.</p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>
    <p>This is how you make an unordered list:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p>Add a "ul" element (it stands for unordered list)</p></li>
      <!-- Nothing can go inside <ul></ul> except for <li></li>, but you can put other stuff such as <p></p> inside <li></li>-->
      <li>Add each item in its own "li" element</li>
      <li>They don't need to be in any particulat order</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is what an ordered list looks like:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Notice the new "ol" element wrapping everything</li>
      <li>But, the list item elements are the same</li>
      <li>Also, note how the numbers increment on their own</li>
      <li>You should be noticing things in this precise order, because this is an ordered list </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- The above elements are "Block-level elements"/"flow content" and always draw on a new line-->

    <h2>Inline Elements</h2>
    <!-- "Inline elements"/"phasing content" can affect sections of text anywhere in a line-->
    <p><em>Sometimes</em>, you need to draw attention to a particular word or phrase.</p>
    <p>Other times you need to <strong>strong</strong>ly emphasize the importance of a word or phrase.</p>
    <p><em><strong>And sometimes you need to shout!</strong></em></p>
    <!-- We use "emphasize" and "strong" instead of "italicize" and bold": HTML just gives the semantics and the structure, not the presentation (we use CSS for that)-->

    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>
    <!--Empty elements don't need to be closed out-->
    <h3>Line Breaks</h3>
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <!-- There won't be a line break on the web page using the above code -->
    <p>Regards,<br/>
    The Authors</p>
    <!-- There will be a hard line break on the web page using the above code, but the <br/> element is by itself (doesn't need to be closed out)-->

    <!-- Don't overuse line breaks, like below (that's what CSS is for)-->
    <p>This paragraph needs some space below it...</p>
    <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
    <p>So, I added some hard line breaks.</p>

    <h3>Horizontal Rules</h3>
    <!-- This is for a horizontal line down the page, again CSS better is for stylistic elements so don't overuse-->
    <p>Thanks for reading! Interneting should be getting easier now.</p>

    <p>P.S. This page might look like crap, but we'll fix that with some CSS soon.</p>
